Current Approach: Chemotherapy → Wait → Scan → Adjust
Ant Colony Approach: Real-time adaptive therapy

```python
class CancerTherapyColony:
    def dynamic_treatment_adaptation(self, tumor_evolution_data):
        # Continuous monitoring of tumor genomics
        resistance_mutations = self.detect_emerging_resistance(tumor_evolution_data)
        
        # Predictive therapy switching
        next_therapy = self.predict_optimal_switch(current_therapy, resistance_mutations)
        
        # Micro-dosing optimization to prevent resistance
        optimal_schedule = self.calculate_adaptive_dosing(next_therapy, tumor_kinetics)
        
        return DynamicTherapyRegimen(next_therapy, optimal_schedule)
```
